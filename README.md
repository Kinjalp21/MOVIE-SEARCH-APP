## Objective:
The Movie Search App is a feature-rich web application built using React.js. This app allows users to search for movies and retrieve detailed information by fetching data from a public API (like OMDb API). Users can use the search functionality to access the movie they want to know about by inputing the movie name in the search box, also they can utilize the sort by and genre filter. Users can also save their favorite movies for quick access later. </br>
